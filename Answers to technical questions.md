# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately **12 hours** working on the coding test. This time included planning, coding, testing, and refining the task management application.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

One of the most useful features added in the latest version of **JavaScript** (specifically React JS in my case) is **React Hooks** (e.g., `useState` and `useEffect`), which allow us to manage state and side effects in functional components.

### Example Code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const TaskManager = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch tasks from local storage when the component mounts
    const savedTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')) || [];
    setTasks(savedTasks);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Task Manager</h1>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task) => (
          <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TaskManager;
```

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

### Steps to Track Down a Performance Issue in Production:

1. **Analyze Browser Logs:**
   - If performance issues occur on the front-end (such as slow task loading or UI lag), I would start by examining the browser's **DevTools** console for any error messages or failed requests. I would check for issues related to rendering, network requests, or JavaScript execution.
   - I would use tools like **Google Chrome DevTools** to profile JavaScript execution, monitor network activity, and check rendering performance.

2. **Monitor Local Storage Access:**
   - Since the task data is stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, I would inspect how the app retrieves and updates data from localStorage.
   - Inefficient use of localStorage (e.g., reading and writing data too frequently) can slow down the application. I would ensure that localStorage operations are optimized and consider batch updating or caching strategies.

3. **Use Performance Monitoring Tools:**
   - For deeper insights into the production environment, I would use monitoring tools like **Google Lighthouse** to analyze page load performance, resource utilization, and any front-end bottlenecks.
   - If the app is deployed and accessed through a web server, I would monitor server logs to look for high response times or errors.

4. **Optimize State Management (React Redux):**
   - If state updates (via **Redux Toolkit**) are causing unnecessary re-renders or updates, it can lead to performance issues. I would use the **React Developer Tools** to analyze the component render cycle and ensure that the app is not rendering unnecessary components.
   - I would also make sure that actions dispatched in Redux are optimized and that state is managed efficiently.

5. **Improve Caching and Data Fetching:**
   - For frequently accessed data, implementing **caching** (e.g., using **Redis**) could be a potential solution to reduce latency and server load.
   - If future versions of the app integrate with external services (e.g., task syncing with other platforms), I would use **background jobs** and **caching** to reduce the number of external API calls.

### Have I Ever Had to Track Down a Performance Issue?

Yes, I’ve had to track down a performance issue in a previous project. While working on a task management application (similar to this one), I noticed that tasks were taking too long to load on certain pages. After inspecting the browser logs and using **Chrome DevTools**, I realized that the app was making frequent calls to `localStorage` to fetch tasks, which was slowing down the page rendering, especially when the task list grew larger.

To resolve this issue, I:
- Optimized the **localStorage** access by reducing the frequency of reads and writing data only when necessary.
- Leveraged **React.memo** and **useCallback** to optimize re-renders and ensure that components were not unnecessarily re-rendering on state updates.

After these changes, the app’s performance improved significantly, and the loading times were reduced.

## 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application:

### 1. **Task Deadlines and Reminders:**
   - **Due Date Reminders**: Implement automatic reminders for tasks that are approaching their due date. Users would get a notification or an alert when a task is due soon.
   - **Recurring Tasks**: Add the ability to create recurring tasks for tasks that need to be completed on a regular basis (e.g., weekly, monthly). This would reduce the need for manual re-entry of repetitive tasks.

### 2. **User Authentication and Profiles:**
   - **User Authentication**: Introduce authentication (e.g., via OAuth or JWT) to allow users to sign up, log in, and access their tasks across different devices.
   - **Profile Management**: Allow users to manage their profiles, set preferences, and customize task settings such as default sorting, notification preferences, and themes.

### 3. **Collaboration Features:**
   - **Task Assignment**: Allow users to assign tasks to other team members or collaborators. This would make the app more useful for project management in teams.
   - **Comments and Attachments**: Introduce the ability to add comments to tasks and attach files (documents, images) to tasks for collaboration and better task management.
   
### 4. **Dark Mode and Custom Themes:**
   - **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode for users who prefer a darker interface, especially useful for working in low-light environments.
   - **Custom Themes**: Allow users to personalize the look of the application with custom themes or color schemes for a more tailored user experience.

These improvements would add more functionality and flexibility to the task management application, making it more suitable for both individual and team use, as well as increasing user engagement with useful features like notifications, reminders, and progress tracking.
